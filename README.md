# SwiM-VAC

While the MaNGA survey provides high-resolution optical IFU spectroscopy necessary to study star formation and quenching, the lack of simultaneous ultraviolet (UV) information with a resolution that matches MaNGA limits the questions that can be addressed with this data, particularly about dust and star formation and its quenching. In order to facilitate studies that require UV coverage with matching spatial resolution, we have cross-matched MaNGA DR15 catalog with galaxies observed by Swift UVOT from the Swift archive and created the Swift+MaNGA (SwiM) value added catalog, which comprises 150 galaxies. Besides a catalog that includes the integrated photometry from Swift, this VAC also includes a large number of emission line and spectral indices maps, Swift UVOT images (uvw1, uvw2, and uvm2), SDSS ugriz images, all matched to the same angular resolution and spatial sampling as the uvw2 band. This will allow spatially resolved studies with consistent binning and resolution across UV and optical imaging, and optical spectroscopy. For the Lick indices maps, we adopted the older definition (Burstein et al. 1984; Faber et al. 1985) to define the continuum, which would allow more convenient spatial binning and comparison with composite stellar population model. Please refer to the data model and Molina et al. (2020b) for details.
